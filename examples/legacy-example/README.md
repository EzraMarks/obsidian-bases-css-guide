# LEGACY EXAMPLE - NOT RECOMMENDED FOR NEW PROJECTS

⚠️ **This example is preserved for historical reference and existing implementations. For new projects, use the [Current Example](../current-example/) instead.**

## Why Is This Legacy?

This example demonstrates the original property packing technique using `link()` functions with custom href attributes, as described in the [Legacy Documentation](../../LEGACY-README.md). 

Obsidian has since released an `html()` function that allows for standard HTML/CSS usage and is less brittle to future Obsidian updates, as described in the recommended [Current Documentation](../../README.md) and demonstrated in the [Current Example](../current-example/)

## Known Issue

Obsidian's November 2025 update causes multiple link icons to appear. See [issue #1](https://github.com/EzraMarks/obsidian-bases-css-guide/issues/1) for a CSS workaround.

## Setup Instructions

1. Add `music-library-example-styles.css` to your Obsidian CSS snippets (Settings → Appearance → CSS snippets)
2. Place the `Music Library` folder anywhere in your Obsidian vault
3. Open the contained Base and explore!
